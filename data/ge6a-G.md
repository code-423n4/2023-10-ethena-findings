## Redundant getUnvestedAmount() call in transferInRewards()

```
 function transferInRewards(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant onlyRole(REWARDER_ROLE) notZero(amount) {
    if (getUnvestedAmount() > 0) revert StillVesting();
    uint256 newVestingAmount = amount + getUnvestedAmount(); @audit

    vestingAmount = newVestingAmount;
    lastDistributionTimestamp = block.timestamp;
    // transfer assets from rewarder to this contract
    IERC20(asset()).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

    emit RewardsReceived(amount, newVestingAmount);
}
```

If the function doesn't revert on the first line, this means that getUnvestedAmount() = 0. Therefore, it doesn't make sense for its value to be added to the amount -> amount + 0 = amount. I propose the following adjustments which will save 553 gas.

```
 function transferInRewards(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant onlyRole(REWARDER_ROLE) notZero(amount) {
    if (getUnvestedAmount() > 0) revert StillVesting();

    vestingAmount = amount;
    lastDistributionTimestamp = block.timestamp;
    // transfer assets from rewarder to this contract
    IERC20(asset()).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

    emit RewardsReceived(amount, amount);
}
```
