Ethnea protocol codebase is compact and neat. The protocol's main logic lies in the `EthenaMinting.sol` and `StakedUSDeV2.sol`. The stable coin, USDe, that the protocol offers to users has a very simple contract. 
This codebase has already undergone a series security of security reviews which is a very good practice security wise and will inspire trust among users and investors. However although the code itself might be secure there is a centralization question that arises. 
In the second paragraph of the gitbook documentation the ethena protocol introduces itself as censorship resistant ("Ethena's synthetic dollar, USDe, will provide the first censorship resistant, scalable and stable crypto-native solution for money achieved by delta-hedging staked Ethereum collateral"), which is a noble cause that many defi protocol have as a core value. Although this project wants to seen as censorship resistant, I don't think it is the case, because it is already subject to strict financial regulation. Users from certain countries won't be able to generate yield through this protocol, and will be given a restricted role. 
This kind of model doesn't really adhere to censorship resistance in my opinion. This kind of mentality can make us wonder if the users are really safe against blacklisting given that this project is entirely subject to discretionary financial regulations. If some country disagrees having its citizen using this protocol in order to regain power over its citizen, will the governance abide to these new regulations ?
