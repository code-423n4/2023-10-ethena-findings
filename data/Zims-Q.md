The contract could include a require statement to check if the contract has enough USDe tokens before attempting to transfer. This would prevent the transaction from failing due to insufficient funds. Here's how you could modify the withdraw function:

```
function withdraw(address to, uint256 amount) external onlyStakingVault {
    require(USDE.balanceOf(address(this)) >= amount, "Insufficient funds");
    USDE.transfer(to, amount);
}
```
