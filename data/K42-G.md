## Gas Optimization Report for [Ethena-Labs](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ethena) by K42

### Possible Optimizations in [EthenaMinting.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ethena/blob/main/contracts/EthenaMinting.sol)

Possible Optimization 1 =
- The contract uses ``keccak256`` for role management [(e.g., MINTER_ROLE, REDEEMER_ROLE, etc.)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ethena/blob/main/contracts/EthenaMinting.sol#L39C1-L46C75). Bitwise operations is a more gas-efficient way to manage roles.

After Optimization:





```solidity
// Before
bytes32 private constant MINTER_ROLE = keccak256("MINTER_ROLE");

// After
uint256 private constant MINTER_ROLE = 1 << 1;
```





- Estimated Gas Saved =  This would reduce the gas cost for ``SSTORE`` and ``SLOAD`` operations related to role management. The bitwise operation uses fewer opcodes compared to keccak256.
- Safety = This is safe as long as the bitwise constants are managed carefully to avoid overlap.

Possible Optimization 2 = 
- The contract has multiple revert conditions in functions like [mint()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ethena/blob/main/contracts/EthenaMinting.sol#L162C1-L187C4) and [redeem()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ethena/blob/main/contracts/EthenaMinting.sol#L194C1-L216C4). Using short-circuiting can save gas when the first condition is not met.

After Optimization:





```solidity
// Before
if (order.order_type != OrderType.MINT) revert InvalidOrder();
verifyOrder(order, signature);

// After
if (order.order_type != OrderType.MINT || !verifyOrder(order, signature)) revert InvalidOrder();
```





- Estimated Gas Saved =  Minimal but every bit counts. Short-circuiting avoids the execution of subsequent conditions if the first one is not met. Fewer opcodes due to reduced conditional checks.
- Safety = This is safe as long as the conditions do not have side effects that are expected to be executed.

Possible Optimization 3 = 
- Declare temporary variables like [totalTransferred](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ethena/blob/main/contracts/EthenaMinting.sol#L423), [amountToTransfer](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ethena/blob/main/contracts/EthenaMinting.sol#L425) within the smallest possible scope to free up stack space.

Here is the optimized code snippet:




```solidity
// Before
uint256 totalTransferred = 0;
for (uint256 i = 0; i < addresses.length; ++i) {
    uint256 amountToTransfer = (amount * ratios[i]) / 10_000;
    // ...
}

// After
for (uint256 i = 0; i < addresses.length; ++i) {
    uint256 amountToTransfer = (amount * ratios[i]) / 10_000;
    uint256 totalTransferred = 0;
    // ...
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = Minimal but improves readability and stack management. This is safe and improves the maintainability of the contract.

### Possible Optimizations in [StakedUSDe.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ethena/blob/main/contracts/StakedUSDe.sol)

Possible Optimization 1 =
- This contract uses custom modifiers [notZero](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ethena/blob/main/contracts/StakedUSDe.sol#L50C1-L53C4) and [notOwner](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ethena/blob/main/contracts/StakedUSDe.sol#L56C1-L59C4) for simple checks. Using ``require`` directly in the function can be more gas-efficient.

After Optimization:





```solidity
// Before
modifier notZero(uint256 amount) {
  if (amount == 0) revert InvalidAmount();
  _;
}

// After
// Use require directly in the function
require(amount != 0, "InvalidAmount");
```





- Estimated Gas Saved = Minimal but every bit counts. Removes the overhead of an extra function call.
- Safety = This is safe as long as the conditions are checked properly.

Possible Optimization 2 = 
- Use ``calldata`` for function parameters that are not modified within the function to save gas.

After Optimization:





```solidity
// Before
function addToBlacklist(address target, bool isFullBlacklisting) external ...

// After
function addToBlacklist(address calldata target, bool isFullBlacklisting) external ...
```





- Estimated Gas Saved = Minimal but every bit counts. ``calldata`` is cheaper than memory or storage.
- Safety = This is safe as long as the parameters are not modified within the function.

Possible Optimization 3 = 
- Instead of using separate roles for [FULL_RESTRICTED_STAKER_ROLE](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ethena/blob/main/contracts/StakedUSDe.sol#L32C1-L32C99) and [SOFT_RESTRICTED_STAKER_ROLE](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ethena/blob/main/contracts/StakedUSDe.sol#L30), use bitwise operations to manage multiple roles.

Optimized Code Snippet:




```solidity
// Before
bytes32 private constant FULL_RESTRICTED_STAKER_ROLE = keccak256("FULL_RESTRICTED_STAKER_ROLE");
bytes32 private constant SOFT_RESTRICTED_STAKER_ROLE = keccak256("SOFT_RESTRICTED_STAKER_ROLE");

// After
uint256 private constant FULL_RESTRICTED_STAKER_ROLE = 1 << 1;
uint256 private constant SOFT_RESTRICTED_STAKER_ROLE = 1 << 2;
```




- Estimated Gas Saved = This would reduce the gas cost for ``SSTORE`` and ``SLOAD`` operations related to role management.
- Safety = This is safe as long as the bitwise constants are managed carefully to avoid overlap.
- Extra Context = The bot report list mentions the use of bitwise operations and assembly for various optimizations, however it doesn't specifically address the concept of using bitwise operations for role management. Therefore this is unique in relation to the bot report.

### Possible Optimizations in [StakedUSDeV2.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ethena/blob/main/contracts/StakedUSDeV2.sol)

Possible Optimization 1 =
-  Instead of having two separate functions [(cooldownAssets() and cooldownShares())](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ethena/blob/main/contracts/StakedUSDeV2.sol#L95C2-L122C4) that essentially do the same thing but with different parameters, use function overloading to reduce code duplication.

After Optimization:





```solidity
function cooldown(uint256 amount, address owner, bool isAsset) external ensureCooldownOn returns (uint256) {
    uint256 limit = isAsset ? maxWithdraw(owner) : maxRedeem(owner);

    if (amount > limit) revert ExcessiveAmount();

    uint256 otherAmount = isAsset ? previewWithdraw(amount) : previewRedeem(amount);
    cooldowns[owner].cooldownEnd = uint104(block.timestamp) + cooldownDuration;
    cooldowns[owner].underlyingAmount += amount;
    _withdraw(_msgSender(), address(silo), owner, amount, otherAmount);

    return otherAmount;
}
```





- Estimated Gas Saved = This would save gas on contract deployment due to reduced bytecode size.
- Safety = This is safe as long as the function is called correctly with the ``isAsset`` parameter to distinguish between assets and shares.

Possible Optimization 2 = 
- Instead of using ``revert`` statements, emit ``events`` for errors. This can save gas because revert consumes all remaining gas, while emitting an event will not.

After Optimization:





```solidity
event Error(string reason);

modifier ensureCooldownOff() {
    if (cooldownDuration != 0) emit Error("OperationNotAllowed");
    else _;
}

modifier ensureCooldownOn() {
    if (cooldownDuration == 0) emit Error("OperationNotAllowed");
    else _;
}
```





- Estimated Gas Saved = Minimal, but it will save the remaining gas when an operation is not allowed.

### Possible Optimizations in [SingleAdminAccessControl.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ethena/blob/main/contracts/SingleAdminAccessControl.sol)

Possible Optimization 1 = 
- Instead of emitting separate events for admin transfer, role grant, and role revoke, use a single event to indicate any role change.

After Optimization:




```solidity
event RoleChanged(address indexed account, bytes32 role, bool isGranted);

function _grantRole(bytes32 role, address account) internal override {
    // ... existing code
    emit RoleChanged(account, role, true);
}

function _revokeRole(bytes32 role, address account) internal override {
    // ... existing code
    emit RoleChanged(account, role, false);
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This would save gas on contract deployment due to reduced bytecode size.
- Safety = This is safe as long as the event is properly documented to indicate what isGranted means.

Possible Optimization 2 = 
-  Instead of using multiple modifiers like ``onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)`` and ``notAdmin(role)``, use bitfields to combine multiple checks into a single modifier.

After Optimization: 




```solidity
modifier roleChecks(bytes32 role, uint8 checks) {
    if ((checks & 0x01) == 0x01 && !hasRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender)) revert InvalidAdminChange();
    if ((checks & 0x02) == 0x02 && role == DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) revert InvalidAdminChange();
    _;
}

function grantRole(bytes32 role, address account) public override roleChecks(role, 0x03) {
    _grantRole(role, account);
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This would save gas by reducing the number of modifiers and therefore the number of jumps in the EVM. Reduces the number of ``JUMP`` and ``JUMPI`` opcodes.
- Safety = This is safe as long as the bitfield is properly managed.
