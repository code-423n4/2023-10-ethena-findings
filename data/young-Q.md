For operations needs to emit corresponding events to inform the users but doesn't in the contract. This could lead to the untrust between the project party and the project owners. We recommend adding necessary event-emission for these privileged functions.

Below are some findings:

- [`rescueTokens` function in `StakedUSDe.sol`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ethena/blob/ee67d9b542642c9757a6b826c82d0cae60256509/contracts/StakedUSDe.sol#L138)

This is a 1st-party operation, and event on this should be necessary.
```
  function rescueTokens(address token, uint256 amount, address to) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    if (address(token) == asset()) revert InvalidToken();
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(to, amount);
  }
```

- [`unstake` function in `StakedUSDeV2.sol`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ethena/blob/ee67d9b542642c9757a6b826c82d0cae60256509/contracts/StakedUSDeV2.sol#L78C1-L90C4)
This is an important opeartion, and event should be necessary.
```
  function unstake(address receiver) external {
    UserCooldown storage userCooldown = cooldowns[msg.sender];
    uint256 assets = userCooldown.underlyingAmount;

    if (block.timestamp >= userCooldown.cooldownEnd) {
      userCooldown.cooldownEnd = 0;
      userCooldown.underlyingAmount = 0;

      silo.withdraw(receiver, assets);
    } else {
      revert InvalidCooldown();
    }
  }
```

- [`cooldownAssets` function in `StakedUSDeV2.sol`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ethena/blob/ee67d9b542642c9757a6b826c82d0cae60256509/contracts/StakedUSDeV2.sol#L95)
This is an important opeartion, and event should be necessary.
```
  function cooldownAssets(uint256 assets, address owner) external ensureCooldownOn returns (uint256) {
    if (assets > maxWithdraw(owner)) revert ExcessiveWithdrawAmount();

    uint256 shares = previewWithdraw(assets);

    cooldowns[owner].cooldownEnd = uint104(block.timestamp) + cooldownDuration;
    cooldowns[owner].underlyingAmount += assets;

    _withdraw(_msgSender(), address(silo), owner, assets, shares);

    return shares;
  }
```

- [`cooldownAssets` function in `StakedUSDeV2.sol`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ethena/blob/ee67d9b542642c9757a6b826c82d0cae60256509/contracts/StakedUSDeV2.sol#L111)
This is an important opeartion, and event should be necessary.
```
  function cooldownShares(uint256 shares, address owner) external ensureCooldownOn returns (uint256) {
    if (shares > maxRedeem(owner)) revert ExcessiveRedeemAmount();

    uint256 assets = previewRedeem(shares);

    cooldowns[owner].cooldownEnd = uint104(block.timestamp) + cooldownDuration;
    cooldowns[owner].underlyingAmount += assets;

    _withdraw(_msgSender(), address(silo), owner, assets, shares);

    return assets;
  }
