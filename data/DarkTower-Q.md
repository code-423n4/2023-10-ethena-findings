## [NCâ€‘1] Unnecessary operation in `StakedUSDe.sol` which consumes Gas

Function `transferInRewards` in StakedUSDe.sol has an unnecessary operation which always results in adding zero.

The problem occurs in this line:

```solidity
uint256 newVestingAmount = amount + getUnvestedAmount();
```

As the function first checks `if (getUnvestedAmount() > 0) revert StillVesting();`, the value of `getUnvestedAmount()` will always be zero at the next line.

Mitigation steps:
Simply delete this part `+ getUnvestedAmount()` at line 91 in the code of `StakedUSDe.sol`
