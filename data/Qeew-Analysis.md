1. Review of Documentation: Started with thorough overview of the READ.ME file to understand the purpose and design method of the protocol.
2. Functional Testing: Executed test cases provided within the codebase to ensure functionality aligns with documentation.
3. EIP / ERC Compatibility: The EIPS used were extensively reviewed to ensure their compliances with the Official Specifications.
4. The Openzepplin Libraries used were extensively checked for any known security vulnerabilities
 

The protocol is highly centralized as the key components in the system are heavily controlled by the Protocol leaving users with only minimal function or role to take. I understand this is all due to compliance to regulations but this stood clear off what decentralized platforms are known for


The utilization of Steth, a rebase token, introduces potential systemic risks. Though the team has expressed confidence in their insurance mechanisms, relying on a rebase token inherently brings about risks of not maintaining 1:1 ratio with ETH. Using a non-rebase version of Steth, which is Wsteth might be a safer alternative to consider.
