## a) The approach I followed when reviewing the code

First, by examining the scope of the code, I determined my code review and analysis strategy.

Accordingly, I analyzed and audited the subject in the following steps;

| Number |Stage |Details|Information|
|:--|:----------------|:------|:------|
|1|Compile and Run Test|[Installation](--link--)|Test and installation structure is simple, cleanly designed|
|2|Architecture Review|The [--text--](--link--) explainer provides a high-level overview of the Project system and the describe the core components.|Provides a basic architectural teaching for General Architecture|
|3|Graphical Analysis  |Graphical Analysis with [Solidity-metrics](https://github.com/ConsenSys/solidity-metrics)|A visual view has been made to dominate the general structure of the codes of the project.|
|4|Slither Analysis  | [Slither Report](https://github.com/crytic/slither)| The project does not currently have a slither result, a slither control was created from scratch |
|5|Test Suits|[Tests](--link--)|In this section, the scope and content of the tests of the project are analyzed.|
|6|3 Stage Audit Strategy |[Scope](--link--)|Top-down analysis of codes according to architectural design, IDE used: VsCode| Remix
