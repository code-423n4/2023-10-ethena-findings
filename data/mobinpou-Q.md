In this line: [USDe.sol Line 28](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ethena/blob/ee67d9b542642c9757a6b826c82d0cae60256509/contracts/USDe.sol#L28), you mention that the minter address is the only address with the ability to mint USDe tokens. This minter address possesses one of the most powerful non-owner permissions, as it can create an unlimited amount of USDe tokens. To ensure that it always points to the `EthenaMinting.sol` contract, you can consider modifying the contract structure.

One approach is to remove the `setMinter` function and initialize the minter address within the constructor like this:

```solidity
constructor(address admin, address EthenaMintingAddress) ERC20("USDe", "USDe") ERC20Permit("USDe") {
    if (admin == address(0) || EthenaMintingAddress == address(0)) revert ZeroAddressException();
    _transferOwnership(admin);
    minter = EthenaMintingAddress;
}
```
With this approach, when the contract is created, the minter address is set to the address of the EthenaMinting contract. If the EthenaMinting contract changes its address, you would need to redeploy the USDe contract with the updated EthenaMinting address.

To enhance control and security, you can also consider using an upgradable contract pattern to maintain the same address for the USDe contract even when the EthenaMinting contract is updated. Additionally, you can modify the setMinter function to restrict the minter address to the EthenaMinting contract. This ensures that the minter address can only be set to a trusted and valid EthenaMinting contract address, preventing any potential issues.
