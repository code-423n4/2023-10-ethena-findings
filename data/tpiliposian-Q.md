## 1. Use safetransfer instead of transfer

### Description 

In the `USDeSilo` contract, the USDE token is an instance of an ERC20 token. However, using the SafeERC20 library's `safeTransfer` function is considered a best practice, even when dealing with standard ERC20 tokens.

The SafeERC20 library adds additional checks to ensure that the token transfer functions return true (indicating a successful transfer), and it will revert the transaction if the transfer fails. This is a safety measure to protect against potential issues with tokens that might not fully comply with the ERC20 standard or unexpected behavior in future token implementations.

So, it's generally a best practice to use `SafeERC20.safeTransfer` or `SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom` when transferring ERC20 tokens, even if the tokens are known to be standard-compliant. This helps ensure the robustness and security of your smart contract code by catching potential issues early.

```solidity
  function withdraw(address to, uint256 amount) external onlyStakingVault {
    USDE.transfer(to, amount);
  }
```

### Remediation 

The contract already imports `SafeERC20.sol`, so use `safetransfer` instead of `transfer` in `withdraw()` function.
