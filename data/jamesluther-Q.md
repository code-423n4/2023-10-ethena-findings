Summary of Findings

Vulnerability Detail 

Detect missing zero address validation.
The vulnerability titled "Detect missing zero address validation" refers to the lack of validation for the 'newMinter' address in the 'setMinter' function (lines 23-25). The function allows the contract owner to set a new minter without checking if the 'newMinter' address is a zero address (address(0)). This could potentially allow the owner to unintentionally set the minter to a zero address, which would effectively lock the minting function since no valid Ethereum address could call the 'mint' function. This could result in a permanent loss of functionality, as new tokens could no longer be minted.

Detect missing zero address validation.
Severity: Low

The vulnerability titled "Detect missing zero address validation" refers to the lack of validation for the 'newMinter' address in the 'setMinter' function (lines 23-25). The function allows the contract owner to set a new minter without checking if the 'newMinter' address is a zero address (address(0)). This could potentially allow the owner to unintentionally set the minter to a zero address, which would effectively lock the minting function since no valid Ethereum address could call the 'mint' function. This could result in a permanent loss of functionality, as new tokens could no longer be minted.

Code Snippet

```solidity
function setMinter(address newMinter) external onlyOwner {
if (newMinter == address(0)) revert ZeroAddressException();
emit MinterUpdated(newMinter, minter);
minter = newMinter;
}
```

Recommendation: To resolve this issue, you should add a condition to check if the 'newMinter' address is a zero address before setting it as the new minter. If the 'newMinter' address is a zero address, the function should revert. Here is the updated 'setMinter' function:  ```solidity function setMinter(address newMinter) external onlyOwner {   if (newMinter == address(0)) revert ZeroAddressException();   emit MinterUpdated(newMinter, minter);   minter = newMinter; } ```  This will prevent the contract owner from unintentionally setting the minter to a zero address, ensuring the minting function can always be called by a valid Ethereum address.
