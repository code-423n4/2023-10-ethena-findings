Potential security issues:

Centralization risk: The contract has a single admin role that has significant control over the contract, including the ability to blacklist addresses and rescue tokens. This centralization could be a risk if the admin's private key is compromised.

Reentrancy attacks: The contract uses the nonReentrant modifier from OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard contract to protect against reentrancy attacks. However, it's important to ensure that all external calls that could potentially be affected by reentrancy are protected.

Role renouncement: The contract overrides the renounceRole function to prevent users from renouncing their roles. This could potentially lock certain functionalities if the only address with a certain role loses access to their private key.

Blacklisting: The contract allows for blacklisting of addresses, which could potentially be misused. It's important to ensure that this functionality is used responsibly and transparently.

Donation attack: The contract checks for a minimum non-zero shares amount to prevent a donation attack. However, the effectiveness of this check would need to be verified.

Integer overflow/underflow: The contract does not seem to use SafeMath for arithmetic operations. However, since Solidity 0.8.0, arithmetic operations revert on underflow and overflow, which should prevent these types of attacks.

Potential security flaws: SingleAdminAccessControl.sol

The contract does not check if the newAdmin address in transferAdmin() is a zero address. This could lead to accidental loss of control if the admin role is transferred to the zero address.
The contract does not check if the account address in grantRole(), revokeRole(), and renounceRole() is a zero address. This could lead to unexpected behavior if these functions are called with the zero address.
The contract does not emit an event when the admin role is revoked in _grantRole(). This could make it harder to track changes to the admin role.
